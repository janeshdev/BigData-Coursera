1.Check all true statements about the Directed Acyclic Graph 
The DAG is managed by the cluster manager
If a partition is lost, the DAG is traversed forward to check what other steps are affected
A DAG is used to track dependencies of each partition of each RDD

2. Why is building a DAG necessary in Spark but not in MapReduce?
Because MapReduce always has the same type of workflow, Spark needs to accommodate diverse workflows.

3. What are the differences between an action and a transformation? Mark all that apply
A transformation is from worker nodes to worker nodes, an action between worker nodes and the Driver (or a data source like HDFS)
A transformation is lazy, an action instead executes immediately.

4.Generally, which are good stages to mark a RDD for caching in memory?
After data cleaning, parsing and validation.
At the start of an iterative algorithm.
The first RDD, just after reading from disk, so we avoid reading from disk again.


5.What are good cases for using a broadcast variable? Mark all that apply
Copy a large configuration dictionary to all worker nodes
Copy a large lookup table to all worker nodes
Copy a small/medium sized RDD for a join
